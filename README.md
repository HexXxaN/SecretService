# SecretService
A simple 2D arcade game 

This game was created for a university assignment.

  Agent A: once a game can increase its speed for 2 seconds
  Agent B: once per game can become invisible for 2 seconds

The current objective of the game is to avoid enemies. Other objectives may appear in the future.
The enemies can detect player radially, and once the player has been detected each enemy agent gets the player location and chases player immediately.
The enemies cannot see through obsticles, and when the player is not detected they can only move on pavements and around the buildings.
